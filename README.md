Robotic-Arm-With-Computer-Vision
================================
The repository contains codes of all programs which i have used for my project "Design of a vision based Robotic Arm for automatic grading of Mangos".

The project had two parts:

I) Development of a Image processing technique for classification of the mangos: Here the images of the mango to be classified are taken, which are then analysed based on the following factors: a) Number of darks spots b) Area of skin damages such as sun burn, fungal infections etc c) Defects in shape. Based on these factors the grade of the mango is decided.

II) Hardware implementation of the robotic arm for automating the process: In this part a prototype of the robotic arm for picking of the mango is developed. The link parameters for reaching to the mango are calculated using inverse kinematics.
